Split/parse string
delims=xxx      - specifies a delimiter set. This replaces the default delimiter set of space and tab.
tokens=x,y,m-n  - specifies which tokens from each line are to be passed to the for body for each iteration. This will cause additional variable names to be allocated. The m-n form is a range, specifying the mth through the nth tokens. If the last character in the tokens= string is an asterisk, then an additional variable is allocated and receives the remaining text on the line after the last token parsed.
FOR /F "delims=/ tokens=1-3" %A IN ("a/b/c") DO echo %A %B %C

Setting value of "" (empty quotes) will appear to delete the variable - it's not shown by SET but the variable name will remain in the registry.

Deleting a variable with REG will not take effect until next logon due to caching of registry data.
